It really comes in handy to use this helper, as they provide a nice source for boilerplate code to bootstrap new frontend projects running with [[1 - Inbox/vite]]. And they even support [[1 - Inbox/Deno]].

```shell
# with deno
deno run -A npm:create-vite-extra

# with npm
npx create-vite-extra
```
