As we mentioned [[1 - Inbox/JS and TS Fullstack Development|here]] `JavaScript` supports many styles, such as functional programming to a point.
 1. Functions are first-class [[1 - Inbox/Objects]]
	 1. Binding to variables
	 2. As parameters for other functions
	 3. As a return value
 2. Data Structures are primarily immutable (for example, `const`)
 3. Declarative
 4. Distinction between _Data_, Functions, and Effect deliberate (see Eric Normand)
 5. Composition: simple functions are wired together to form complex ones.
