## JavaScript
> *What is JavaScript?*

`JavaScript`is part of the [C-family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C-family_programming_languages) languages, meaning a lot of its syntax is similar to Java, C, C++ and the likes. But it's core features are inspired by Scheme and Self (like have a [[1 - Inbox/Functional Style|function]] as a first class citizen value) and in combination with a prototype-based object orientated language style, it's a different language programming experience.

### Language

`JavaScript`is quite open to the paradigms used to code it. It supports functional, [[1 - Inbox/OOP]], event driven and procedural coding, thus it needs some decisions upfront and discipline to have a coherent style. Much also depends on the frameworks and libraries used or the domain (e.G. game development is rather procedural, whereas backend development quite open).

### Developer Setup

We can go either the [[vim]] or [[VSCode Type- and Javascript|VSCode]] route. At the moment my web developer setup is mostly based on the latter.  To get a great developer experience, we need to use a set of runtime, configurations and the right addons/ plugins.

### Libraries

With [[lil-gui]] you can create (debugging) windows, that flow over the application.

### Frameworks

[Phaser3](https://explorer.phaser.io/) is a fast JavaScript Framework that facilitates game development for games running in the browser.
