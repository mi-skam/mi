## üìù Notes
Started to look into [[Neovim Configuration]].  I got inspired by devonduty's [neovim playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ-7ex7je88&list=PLu-ydI-PCl0OEG0ZEqLRRuCrMJGAAI0tW&index=2) 
I opted to look for another plugin manager. and found [üõ†Ô∏è Installation | lazy.nvim](https://lazy.folke.io/installation)

Today I learned cool stuff about [[recursive functions]] in boot.dev. Currently it's in [GitHub - mi-skam/boot.dev: learning repo for boot.dev courses](https://github.com/mi-skam/boot.dev)

What I really liked was, thinking about unwinding of the recursive calls (meaning how it back propagates its value, after the base case is hit). You really have to capture its results in a variable, otherwise the updates get reset to values further up in the stack.

The other thing is, how to work with return values and the code that get's executed while unwinding. 

I definitely noticed that the unwinding is the part where recursion gets complicated (for me).

Big task, now I need to
