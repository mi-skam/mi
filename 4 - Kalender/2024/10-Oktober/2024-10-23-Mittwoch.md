## üìù Notes
Started to look into [[Neovim Configuration]].  I got inspired by devonduty's [neovim playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ-7ex7je88&list=PLu-ydI-PCl0OEG0ZEqLRRuCrMJGAAI0tW&index=2) 
I opted to look for another plugin manager. and found [üõ†Ô∏è Installation | lazy.nvim](https://lazy.folke.io/installation)
Of course, I already stumbled on this topic at some moment in time, and forgot epically about it. There's [GitHub - nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim: A launch point for your personal nvim configuration|kickstart-nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), a kind of "meta-setup" with some sane defaults for neovim ü§™

Today I learned cool stuff about [[recursive functions]] in boot.dev. Currently it's in [GitHub - mi-skam/boot.dev: learning repo for boot.dev courses](https://github.com/mi-skam/boot.dev)

What I really liked was, thinking about unwinding of the recursive calls (meaning how it back propagates its value, after the base case is hit). You really have to capture its results in a variable, otherwise the updates get reset to values further up in the stack.

The other thing is, how to work with return values and the code that get's executed while unwinding. 

I definitely noticed that the unwinding is the part where recursion gets complicated (for me).

Started to look into zig language and got mental, when trying to find a way to debug programs from within vscode. Finally I found [James Errington](https://jameserrington.github.io/blog/2024/debugging-zig/) [[tasks.json]] [[launch.json]]




Big task, now I need to 
- [ ] port my "snrt"-keyboard mapping to vim
